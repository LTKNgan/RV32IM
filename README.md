# DESCRIPTION

This this project, a RV32IM single-cycle processor is designed and use UART communication protocol to receive data/instruction from PC as well as send result to PC. In this project, some programs that can run on RV32IM placed in `testcase`. This project has been tested on Arty-z7 FPGA development board.
